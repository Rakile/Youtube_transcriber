# Youtube_transcriber
A small application to transcribe/translate a youtube clip or a local video or audio file. It uses the free to use OpenAI whisper, and if keys are provided, can also speak the transcription.
Just run the runme.bat to create the virtual environment and also start the application.

Or if you are on another platform (not tested)
Run:

python -m venv youtube_transcriber

Then activate the environment:

.\youtube_transcriber\Scripts\activate.bat  or maybe ./youtube_transcriber/Scripts/activate.sh (if on linux)

Then start the application:

python transcriber_v2.py
